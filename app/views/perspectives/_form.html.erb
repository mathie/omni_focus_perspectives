  <%= omni_text_field f, :title, placeholder: 'Today' do %>
    Give your perspective a snappy title that succinctly describes what it's
    intended to do. This could be, but doesn't have to be, the title you've
    given the perspective in OmniFocus.
  <% end %>
  
  <%= omni_text_area f, :description, rows: 6 do %>
    Describe your perspective. Be sure to give some detail on what you use the
    perspective for &ndash; is it primarily for planning, doing, reviewing, or
    something else entirely? How do you set up your projects and actions so the
    right information appears in this view?
  <% end %>

  <%= omni_check_box f, :sidebar, 'Shown in my sidebar' do %>
    Do you show this view in your sidebar, or is it just for occasional use?
  <% end %>
