<%= render 'shared/errors', model: perspective %>

<%= form_for(perspective, html: { class: 'form-horizontal', role: 'form' }) do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :title, placeholder: 'Today' do %>
    Give your perspective a snappy title that succinctly describes what it's
    intended to do. This could be, but doesn't have to be, the title you've
    given the perspective in OmniFocus.
  <% end %>
  
  <%= f.text_area :description, rows: 6 do %>
    Describe your perspective. Be sure to give some detail on what you use the
    perspective for &ndash; is it primarily for planning, doing, reviewing, or
    something else entirely? How do you set up your projects and actions so the
    right information appears in this view?
  <% end %>

  <%= f.check_box :sidebar do %>
    Do you show this view in your sidebar, or is it just for occasional use?
  <% end %>

  <%= f.submit %>
